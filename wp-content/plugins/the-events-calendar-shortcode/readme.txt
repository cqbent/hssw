Trusted by 20,000+ WordPress sites and a 4.5 star rating on WordPress.org, The Events Calendar Shortcode and Block is the solution you’ve been after :)

**How to use The Events Calendar Shortcode**

You can use the shortcode or block to add a list of your events, filtered by various options. Here’s an example of how you’d show the next 8 events in the category festival:

`[ecs-list-events cat="festival" limit="8"]`

You can also filter the shortcode to choose from the following options:

* Category: show events from specific categories.
* Number of events: choose the number of events to show.
* Event order: Order in which your events are shown (latest first or last).
* Event dates: Show or hide the date.
* Event venue: Show or hide the venue.
* Event excerpt: Show or hide the event excerpt, and set an excerpt length.
* Thumbnail: Show or hide a thumbnail image.
* View all events link: Choose whether to include a “view all events” link or not.
* Events from a specific month: show only events from specific months (including current or next month).
* Previous events: Show previous events.
* Hide started events: Hide events when their start time passes.

This gives you full control over how your events are displayed, and is perfect for non-profits, charities, businesses, conferences, and anyone with a WordPress website showing events.

You’ll find a full list of how to use these options in the shortcode below in the plugin’s FAQs.

= Can I use this plugin to list my events using the new WordPress 5.0 editor (Gutenberg)? =

Yes! There is now a block to list your events anywhere in a page or post, just click "+" in the top-left and search for The Events Calendar Block (under Common).

= How do I use this shortcode in a widget? =

You can put the shortcode in a text widget (as of WordPress 4.7). If a regular text widget doesn't work, put the shortcode in a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/black-studio-tinymce-widget/">Visual Editor Widget</a>.

= What are the classes for styling the list of events? =

By default the plugin does not include styling. Events are listed in ul li tags with appropriate classes for styling with a bit of CSS.

* ul class="ecs-event-list"
* li class="ecs-event" and "ecs-featured-event" (if featured)
* event title link is H4 class="entry-title summary"
* date class is time
* venue class is venue
* span .ecs-all-events
* p .ecs-excerpt
